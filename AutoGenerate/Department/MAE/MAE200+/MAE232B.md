Finite element methods for linear problems in structural dynamics. Beam, plate, and doubly curved shell elements are derived. Strategies for eliminating shear locking problems are introduced. Formulation and numerical solution of the equations of motion for structural dynamics are introduced and the effect of different mass matrix formulations on the solution accuracy is explored.
- Review:  
相較276A，需要更大量的數學理論基礎，開學前幾堂幾乎退了一半的人，要有276A紮實的基礎才能負擔這堂課的loading。教學方式、office hour和276A一樣。
